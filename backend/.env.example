# The JWT secret from Supabase is needed if you want to verify tokens manually,
# but our current backend uses the supabase-js client which handles it if configured correctly.
# However, since we moved to PG raw queries, we might need a way to verify the user identity
# if we want to keep RLS-like logic in the backend services.
